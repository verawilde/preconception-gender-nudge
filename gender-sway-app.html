                    <h3>🐻 Find the bear: A note on epistemic humility</h3>
                    <p>Sex ratios vary naturally by only a few percentage points. Even if these associations are real (and that's a big if), the effects are subtle. No intervention can guarantee a specific outcome.</p>
                    <p>This tool is for exploration and education. The research cited is observational, not experimental. We don't know if these factors <em>cause</em> sex ratio shifts or just happen to be correlated with them. We don't know if attempting to manipulate them would work, or what unintended consequences might follow.</p>
                    <p>As with cancer screenings and vaccine endpoints, we have to think carefully about what we're measuring, what we want to know, and how much uncertainty remains. The endpoint rainbow here is wide: fertilization, implantation, viability, birth, and all the biological and evolutionary mechanisms in between.</p>
                    <p><strong>Count the bodies.</strong> Here, the bodies we're counting are actual bodies: babies. This is a beautiful case study where we can empirically test whether dietary and lifestyle interventions shift sex ratios compared to population baselines. With enough participants tracking their efforts and outcomes, and follow-up studies investigating mechanisms further, we could eventually move from correlation to causation—if there's a signal in the noise.</p>
